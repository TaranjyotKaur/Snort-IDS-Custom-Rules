# Snort-IDS-Custom-Rules

Snort IDS – Rule-Based Detection

This project focuses on implementing a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort.
Custom Snort rules were written and tested to detect common network attacks in a lab environment.

The project helped me understand how Snort rules work and how different types of network traffic can be monitored and analyzed.

Tools: Snort, Kali Linux, Nmap, Netcat
